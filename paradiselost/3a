<h3 id="eu-member-states">3. EU member states</h3>

<p>We also have to wonder whether the EU countries themselves would make the list? This is important since hypocrisy on this front tends to turn against the blacklisting power. When the OECD released its blacklist on harmful tax practices in 2000, it listed many non-member offshore centres but failed to include the likes of Switzerland and Luxembourg who at the time clearly fitted the criteria. This was met with a justifiable backlash from those listed, who used the OECD’s talk of level playing fields for fair taxation against it in what Sharman dubbed: “rhetorical entrapment” (Sharman, 2006).</p>

<p>Now, the EU implemented the CRS by means of the enhanced directive on administrative cooperation in taxation matters (<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/tax_cooperation/mutual_assistance/direct_tax_directive/index_en.htm">European Commission, 2015</a>), and the BEPS measures with the Anti-Tax Avoidance I and II directives. This means that all EU member states are compliant with criteria 1 and 3.</p>

<p>However, Luxembourg, Cyprus and Malta are named as sinks in the CORPNET results, while Netherlands, United Kingdom, and Ireland are considered conduits (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-06322-9">Garcia-Bernardo, Fichtner, Takes, &amp; Heemskerk, 2017</a>). Moreover, a significant number of the listed sink jurisdictions are tied to the UK either as Crown Dependencies or Overseas Territories. The EU might consider this when publishing its blacklist; while the progress of Brexit may also have interesting implications for the bloc’s treatment of the UK itself.</p>
