<p>In this section we look at the extent to which a public database might draw on publicly available data from different sources – by examining different reporting requirements that mandate the collection and publication of the kinds of data that were discussed in the previous section. We start with an overview of how different data sources compare to civil society and OECD standards for Country-by-Country Reporting. Then we go on to look at the current state of national implementations of OECD standards in different countries and regions. Finally we take a closer look at public data from sector specific disclosure rules and voluntary disclosures.</p>

<h4 id="how-do-corporate-disclosure-rules-measure-up-to-civil-society-and-oecd-standards">How Do Corporate Disclosure Rules Measure Up to Civil Society and OECD Standards?</h4>

<p>There are now multiple country-by-country reporting standards, for both public and private data and with significantly varying scope and specificity.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">14</a></sup> This is both a testament to the success of civil society advocates, and a challenge for the effective use of the resulting data.</p>

<p>Part of the motivation for the current project is to respond to this challenge by looking at ways of assembling and aligning CBCR data, and bringing them together alongside other data sources and associated tools. At the same time, the database has the potential to reduce reporter compliance costs (see Cobham, 2014). In this section we consider the likely availability of data in respect of the various standards.</p>

<p>The table below provides an overview of the data fields available under each standard. Cells in green indicate that a standard includes the ‘ideal’ data field. Cells in yellow indicate a related but not fully equivalent field; while cells in red indicate an absence of the field. Three points stand out. First, as noted above, the OECD standard’s omissions relate to activity and to intra-group transactions. This restricts quite seriously the types of questions that can be addressed. Second, the CRD IV standard for public CBCR by EU financial institutions has broadly similar data fields to the OECD standard. Third and perhaps most striking is the extent of omissions across the series of extractive sector standards (as we shall discuss further below).</p>
