<h3 id="conclusion">4. Conclusion</h3>

<p>The EU blacklist could be a tool for forwarding global tax justice, since credible sanction threats by great economic powers can force offshore jurisdictions to cooperate on tax matters (<a href="http://doi.org/10.1080/09692290.2015.1127269">Hakelberg, 2016</a>). However, the process of the EU blacklist seems too deeply flawed to achieve these goals.</p>

<p>By having two criteria explicitly be determined by the OECD CRS and BEPS projects, the blacklist will include the same shortcomings to global tax justice as those processes. First of all, this is likely to result in the exclusion of many lower-income countries both from the input and output of the projects. Second, the OECD is a members club – and just as the EU has decided not to include its own members for equal treatment, so too the OECD struggles to treat its own fairly. By not including the US and phrasing the criteria in such a way that the US is unambiguously excluded from the blacklist, the EU fails to condemn the largest offender to global tax transparency. The EU is likely the only entity that has the necessary economic leverage to compel the US to adopt full AEoI reciprocity, and the US is very aware of that fact. Recent examples of this phenomenon are the tax ruling cases which were aimed at large US tech companies, sparking what some saw as a looming tax war between the two (<a href="https://next.ft.com/content/a40e4b34-c9c7-11e5-be0b-b7ece4e953a0">Jopson &amp; Oliver, 2016</a>).</p>

<p>Thirdly, the second criterion on fair taxation is deliberately vague and leaves a lot of room for either subjective assessments and/or backroom politics. By explicitly authorising the notoriously secretive EU code of conduct group to assess not only whether a jurisdiction qualifies but also if it has cooperated adequately with them, the assessment of criterion two becomes an unaccountable process. This leaves the door wide open for backroom politics and the exclusion of jurisdictions that should be listed in the name of diplomatic interests (although on the upside, Brexit might mean that the UK will not be in the position to object against its Overseas Territories or Crown Dependencies being listed). It also prevents independent researchers from verifying the listing process objectively.</p>

<p>We await release of the final blacklist to see how much of these doubts about the process are founded, and if the EU lets the blacklist be dictated by diplomatic or economic interest rather than the aim of effective taxation, or tax justice. However, past experience teaches that blacklist are often vain attempts, and the wording of the specific EU criteria suggest that this time may be little different. Only when states agree on a comprehensive, transparent and objectively verifiable criteria – such as those in the Financial Secrecy Index – will there be a meaningful list which could validly be used as the basis for economic counter-measures.</p>

<p>An international convention to agree the minimum standards of financial transparency, including with respect to profit shifting, could provide the best way to set legitimate criteria and to ensure the eventual benefits are enjoyed by all. International negotiations with G77 and G20 participation, ideally through the UN system, could confirm three emerging standards as the basis for criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>A.	Full, multilateral automatic exchange of tax information (with fixed-term reciprocity waivers for lower-income countries);</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>B.	Public registers of beneficial ownership for companies, trusts and foundations; and</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>C.	Public country-by-country reporting by multinationals, with jurisdictions committing to reduce the revealed profit misalignment.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Such a convention, with standards agreed and owned by all participants, could set the basis for legitimate blacklisting of those would deny the benefits of globalisation to others – and for meaningful counter-measures.</p>

<p>The EU blacklist, in contrast, will rest on criteria agreed only by one group of powerful countries; whose evaluation cannot be fully verified objectively; and which are then applied to others but not to themselves.</p>
