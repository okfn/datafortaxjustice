<p>Having examined some of the aspirations and envisaged scenarios of usage for a global public database in the previous section, in this section we look at different proposals for what information could and should be contained within it. Firstly we compare different proposals for "Country-by-Country Reporting" (CBCR). Secondly we look at other sources of information that could be contained within a public database – and the kinds of analytical operations that this information would facilitate.</p>

<p>Some early proposals for public CBCR (Murphy, 2003; and e.g. 2012) suggest a broad accountability mechanism for both multinationals and tax authorities. Multinationals’ licence to operate in a given jurisdiction and globally depends on meeting their tax responsibilities, and upon being able to publicly account for having done so. The resulting data provides the public and policymakers with the basis for important economic decision-making. In addition, it will demonstrate alignments and misalignments – in respect of companies, and of jurisdictions – between the location of activity, and the extent of declared profits and tax.</p>
